All the code is in the WWW directory. It is in php and mysql. It assumes a mysql database.

To install it, put the www directory in a directory that is served by a web browser (so you can see it with http://<your-server>/<your-paht>) 
Then, run create_db.php (open it with a web browser, for example). Read the code to see what parameters to pass when writing the URL in your browser (GET parameters).

Lastly, change the database credentials in mysql_connect.php 

Then index.php will allow you to use the program.
